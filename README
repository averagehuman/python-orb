orb
===

A utility wrapper for pip_ and virtualenv_.

install
-------

We assume that virtualenv_ is available, eg. in Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv

pip_ need not be available - it is installed every time to a new environment.

(this ensures that pip is the latest version).

To install, use easy_install to install from pypi.python.org, or simply copy
the orb script from the source distribution, eg.

    $ sudo cp orb /usr/local/bin

usage
-----

Create a virtualenv with the command

   orb init myenv

This creates a virtualenv called 'myenv.orb' and creates an empty '.orb'
file within the virtualenv directory. Subsequent orb commands first search
for the '.orb' file and from this file's location the virtualenv's bin directory
is known. 

To install packages to the env, run the 'orb install' command
(from within the env directory):

   cd myenv
   orb install Pygments
   orb install BeautifulSoup

which calls 'pip_' to do the actual downloading and installation
(pip_ having been installed as part of the init step).

If passed a python script, orb will call it using the virtualenv's python

   eg. orb setup.py install

and if passed any command expression, orb will temporarily alter the
environment (ie. pip's `source activate` step), eval the command,
then restore (pip's `deactivate`).

   eg. (Django): orb django-admin.py startproject myproj
   eg. (Python prompt): orb python
   eg. (Sphinx quickstart): orb sphinx-quickstart
   eg. (Sphinx build): orb make html
   eg. (Arbitrary command) orb ./myshellscript

Other options:

orb lib     - print location of env's site-packages directory
orb ls      - list contents of env's site-packages directory
orb rm      - remove items from env's site-packages directory
orb link    - symlink from the virtual env's site-packages to a system package
orb download PACKAGE [DEST]
            - just download package, don't install


create an env from a requirements file
--------------------------------------

Create an env called 'package-dev-environment.orb' and install requirements::

    orb init ~/my/source/package/REQUIREMENTS package-dev-environment

If the requirements file contains lines such as, for example:

    #SYSTEM: psycopg2 mx
    #SYSTEM: PIL

then suitable symlinks to system packages are created within the env.
